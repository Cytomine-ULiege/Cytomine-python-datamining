This code implements the core algorithms for Random subwindows extraction and Extra-Trees classifiers.
It is used by Cytomine DataMining applications: classification_validation, classification_model_builder, classification_prediction,
segmentation_model_builder and segmentation_prediction.
But it can be run without Cytomine on local data (using dir_ls and dir_ts arguments).

It is based on the following paper:

1) For image/object classification:
Towards generic image classification: an extensive empirical study

2) For image semantic segmentation:
